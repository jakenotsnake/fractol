about fractols
My attempt at 42's project Fractol.
This program can visualize and manipulate factals using complex mathematical formaulas to dictate the color of each pixle.

To use this program:
1. type "make" in the main directory.
 
To use type: ./fractol [Fractol Name]
Current models: [Mandelbrot] [Julia] [Bar]

Controls:
Move: WSAD/Arrows
Zoom in/out: Z/X/Mouse Wheel
Change Colors: Click shit on mouse, also C
Change Julia: J/K

You can also bring up the instructions in the terminal if you type an invalid input.
